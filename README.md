Design a fully responsive personal portfolio website in the style of Clash Royale's UI/UX, blending gamified visuals with professional content presentation.

The website should include the following screens/components:

1. **Splash / Intro Animation Screen**
   - Dark fantasy background (similar to Clash Royale)
   - Animated avatar or initials logo (fantasy-themed)
   - Loading bar with progress text (e.g., "Summoning Projects...")
   - A random tip or witty line at the bottom

2. **Main Dashboard (Home Page)**
   - Top bar:
     - Avatar, name (“Abhinav”), tagline (“Full Stack Engineer – Level 35”)
     - XP bar showing years of experience
     - Gold/Gems stats representing project count / skillsets
   - Center panel:
     - Hero call-to-action button: “Enter Arena” (scrolls to projects)
     - Rotating carousel for featured projects/blogs (“Events Banner” style)
   - Bottom nav bar:
     - Tabs: Projects (Cards), Battle Arena, Shop, Clan, Profile

3. **Project Cards Section ("Card Collection")**
   - Grid layout for projects (like collectible cards)
   - Each card should have:
     - Project name, tech stack icons, thumbnail
     - Rarity-like visual indicator (based on impact or skill level)
     - Hover/focus state with animations and “View Battle” button

4. **Interactive Project Page ("Battle Arena")**
   - Full-width, immersive layout for a selected project
   - Left panel: Problem statement, your approach
   - Center panel: Screenshots or live demo frame
   - Bottom: “Elixir bar” displaying key technologies used
   - Optional: Interactive timeline of project progress

5. **Post-Battle Results Modal**
   - Popup or overlay shown after viewing a project
   - Shows outcomes: performance metrics, learnings, GitHub stars
   - Celebratory animations (XP gain, badge unlocks)

6. **Shop / Skills Screen**
   - Professional services section styled like an in-game shop
   - Sections:
     - Web Dev, UI/UX, Consulting
   - Each “item” with price (fake currency), short description, and “Request Service” button

7. **Clan Hub (Testimonials & Community)**
   - Chat-style testimonial feed
   - Cards for past collaborators with badges and logos
   - Leaderboard view with endorsements or rating stars

8. **Profile / Resume Page**
   - Avatar, name, job title, location
   - Battle Log: Timeline of roles and projects
   - XP/Progress bar toward “Next Level”
   - Charts: GitHub contributions, languages used, etc.
   - Resume download button (prominent)

9. **Settings & Contact Page**
   - Theme toggle (light/dark switch styled like game skins)
   - Contact form:
     - Fields: Name, Email, Message
     - Styled as “Quest Submission Form”
   - Optional: Link to GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter

🎨 Design Guidelines:
- Primary palette: Royal blue, gold, dark purple (Clash Royale vibe)
- Typography: Bold, game-style headers + clean readable body text
- Visuals: Glowing buttons, fantasy textures, dynamic gradients
- Layout: Responsive, component-driven, developer-friendly

Ensure all components are grouped and named properly for easy dev handoff in Figma.
